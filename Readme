MultiBlock class usages

verifyGroupExclusivity(self)
    Prints whether the Multiblock is valid or not.
    This is NOT a boolean.
    
getMinkowskiDifferences(self, element)
    Creates MultiBlock.minkowski_difference_dictionary which contains all Minkowski differences of individual blocks

reorient(self, element)
    Reorients the multiblock to a new orientation given by element.
    For best usage, reorient to MultiBlock.group.neutral after operations are done.

getExcludedVolume(self,element)
    Finds the excluded volume of the Multiblock oriented under the element provided with the same MultiBlock in neutral orientation.
   
MonteCarloExcludedVolumes(self, n=10**6)
    Outputs the excluded volume of the MultiBlock in it's current orientation with the same MultiBlock in neutral orientation.
    This method uses the Monte-Carlo algorithm.
    
calculateExcludedVolumes(self)
    Outputs a dictionary which gives a right_hand_label of a representative of a coset, along with the associated excluded volume.
    This method uses the volume of the union of the Minkowski differences.
